It seems like just last month I was gearing up to dive into the software engineering curriculum and now it's the final credits as I transition to part II and look towards starting my career as a software engineer. Over the last few months, I've learned more than I ever expected to be able to, and have developed a real interest for so many new things It's had to know where to begin.

One of the biggest developments for myself though is the soft-skills that have also come with completing the curriculum, while I expected to be able to develop a web application from head to toe by the end of the course, I didn't realise how much my problem-solving skills would also improve. 

###### > How would you solve a question you don't know the answer to?

If you asked me that 6 months ago before even considering this course, I would have struggled and said "you can't" and that made sense, how could you answer something you didn't know the answer to?
However after developing the ability to break a problem down into smaller components, look inputs, what I am expecting to happen and what is the actual output you can begin to pinpoint how things aren't working how you'd expect. A while simple, these steps really lay the foundations for the ability to solve a problem you don't currently have the answer to - for coding at least.

###### > You don't know what you don't know

I've also come out of the course feeling like I now know even less, which sounds odd, but it's true. Now that I have learned about so many new technologies and had a chance to dip my toes in all of the cool and modern ways developers are using to develop solutions it has opened my eyes to the vast array of things out there - which makes me even more excited, knowing there's the opportunity to always learn something new going forward.

Although this marks the end of my time on the curriculum, it's just the start of what I hope to be a long career in software engineering and I can't wait to get started.
